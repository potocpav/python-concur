# Examples

Here are simple examples, which show various Concur use-cases and patterns.
Any of the `*.py` files can be run directly.

For a slightly more practical (but still very simple) example, see the
[annotation tool](https://github.com/potocpav/annotation-tool) repository.

File | Description
--- | ---
[all.py](all.py) | All the other examples in a single window.
[animation.py](animation.py) | Animated plot.
[counters.py](counters.py) | Classic counter app. Basic state manipulation.
[hello_world.py](hello_world.py) | *Hello, world!* with a single button.
[image.py](image.py) | Image widget with interactive overlay.
[plot.py](plot.py) | Function plot with constrained pan-and-zoom.
[style.py](style.py) | Style switcher, demonstrating direct PyImGui calls.
[timers.py](timers.py) | Asynchronous operations.
[todo.py](todo.py) | Classic TODO list demonstrating more involved state manipulation.

Some extra examples are in the [`extra`](extra) directory, but those may be
experimental and/or not very useful.
